=======================
Running pytest-workflow
=======================
Run ``pytest`` from an environment with pytest-workflow installed or
``python3 -m pytest`` if using a system-wide or user-wide installation.
Pytest will automatically gather files in the ``tests`` directory starting with
``test`` and ending in ``.yaml`` or ``.yml``.

The workflows are run automatically. Each workflow gets its own temporary
directory to run. The ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` of the workflow command are
also saved to this directory. The temporary directories are cleaned up after
the tests are completed. If you wish to inspect the output of a failing
workflow you can use the ``--keep-workflow-wd`` flag to disable cleanup. This
will also make sure the logs of the pipeline are not deleted. The
``--keep-workflow-wd`` flag is highly recommended when debugging pipelines.

If you wish to change the temporary directory in which the workflows are run
use ``--basetemp <dir>`` to change pytest's base temp directory.

.. container:: warning

  WARNING: When a directory is passed to ``--basetemp`` some of the directory
  contents will be deleted. For example: if your workflow is named
  ``"my workflow"`` then any file or directory named ``my_workflow`` will be
  deleted. This makes sure you start with a clean slate if you run pytest
  again with the same ``basetemp`` directory.
  DO NOT use ``--basetemp`` on directories where none of the
  contents should be deleted.

To run multiple workflows simultaneously you can use
``--workflow-threads <int>`` or ``--wt <int>`` flag. This defines the number
of workflows that can be run simultaneously. This will speed up things if
you have enough resources to process these workflows simultaneously.

Running specific workflows
----------------------------
To run a specific workflow use the ``--tag`` flag. Each workflow is tagged with
its own name and additional tags in the ``tags`` key of the yaml.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: moo
    tags:
      - animal
    command: echo moo
  - name: cock-a-doodle-doo
    tags:
      - rooster sound
      - animal
    command: echo cock-a-doodle-doo
  - name: vroom vroom
    tags:
      - car
    command: echo vroom vroom

With the command ``pytest --tag moo`` only the workflow named 'moo' will be
run. With ``pytest --tag 'rooster sound'`` only the 'cock-a-doodle-doo'
workflow will run. Multiple tags can be used like this:
``pytest --tag 'rooster sound' --tag animal`` This will run all workflows that
have both 'rooster sound' and 'animal'.

Internally names and tags are handled the same so if the following tests:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: hello
    command: echo 'hello'
  - name: hello2
    command: echo 'hello2'
    tags:
      - hello

are run with ``pytest --tag hello`` then both ``hello`` and ``hello2`` are run.
