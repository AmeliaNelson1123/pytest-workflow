Snakemake example
-----------------

An example yaml file that could be used to test a snakemake pipeline is listed
below.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: test-dry-run
      command: snakemake -n -r -p -s Snakefile
    - name: test-full-run
      command: snakemake -r -p -s Snakefile
      files:
        - "my_output.txt"
      stderr:
        contains:
         - "(100%) done"

WDL with Cromwell example
-------------------------

Below an example yaml file is explained which can be used to test a WDL
pipeline run through Cromwell.

By default Cromwell outputs its files in the execution folder in a
deeply-nested folder structure. Cromwell can output to a separate
workflow-outputs folder and since Cromwell version 40 it can also output the
files in a structure that is not nested. For more information check the
`Cromwell documentation on global workflow options
<https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/wf_options/Overview/#global-workflow-options>`_.

In order to run Cromwell for CI tests an options file should be present in the
repository with the following contents:

.. code-block:: json

    {
    "final_workflow_outputs_dir": "test-output",
    "use_relative_output_paths": true,
    "default_runtime_attributes": {
      "docker_user": "$EUID"
      }
    }

``final_workflow_outputs_dir`` will make sure all the files produced in the
workflow will be copied to the ``final_workflow_outputs_dir``.
``use_relative_output_paths`` will get rid of all the Cromwell specific folders
such as ``call-myTask`` etc. The ``default_runtime_attributes`` are only
necessary when using docker containers. It will make sure all the files are
created by the same user that runs the test (docker containers run as root by
default). This will ensure that files can be deleted by pytest-workflow
afterwards.

The following yaml file tests a Cromwell pipeline. In this case Cromwell is
installed via conda. The conda installation adds a wrapper to Cromwell so it
can be used as a command, instead of having to use the jar.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: My pipeline
    command: cromwell run -i inputs.json -o options.json moo.wdl'
    files:
      - path: test-output/moo.txt.gz
        md5sum: 173fd8023240a8016033b33f42db14a2
    stdout:
      contains:
        - "WorkflowSucceededState"
