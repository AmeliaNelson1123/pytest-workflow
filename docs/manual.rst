==================================
Writing tests with pytest-workflow
==================================

Below is an example of a YAML file that defines a test:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: Touch a file
    command: touch test.file
    files:
      - path: test.file

This will run ``touch test.file`` and check afterwards if a file with path:
``test.file`` is present. It will also check if the ``command`` has exited
with exit code ``0``, which is the only default test that is run. Testing
workflows that exit with another exit code is also possible.

A more advanced example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: moo file                     # The name of the workflow (required)
    command: bash moo_workflow.sh      # The command to execute the workflow (required)
    files:                             # A list of files to check (optional)
      - path: "moo.txt"                # File path. (Required for each file)
        contains:                      # A list of strings that should be in the file (optional)
          - "moo"
        must_not_contain:              # A list of strings that should NOT be in the file (optional)
          - "Cock a doodle doo"
        md5sum: e583af1f8b00b53cda87ae9ead880224   # Md5sum of the file (optional)

  - name: simple echo                  # A second workflow. Notice the starting `-` which means
    command: "echo moo"                # that workflow items are in a list. You can add as much workflows as you want
    files:
      - path: "moo.txt"
        should_exist: false            # Whether a file should be there or not. (optional, if not given defaults to true)
    stdout:                            # Options for testing stdout (optional)
      contains:                        # List of strings which should be in stdout (optional)
        - "moo"
      must_not_contain:                # List of strings that should NOT be in stout (optional)
        - "Cock a doodle doo"

  - name: mission impossible           # Also failing workflows can be tested
    tags:                              # A list of tags that can be used to select which test
      - should fail                    # is run with pytest using the `--tag` flag.
    command: bash impossible.sh
    exit_code: 2                       # What the exit code should be (optional, if not given defaults to 0)
    files:
      - path: "fail.log"               # Multiple files can be tested for each workflow
      - path: "TomCruise.txt"
    stderr:                            # Options for testing stderr (optional)
      contains:                        # A list of strings which should be in stderr (optional)
        - "BSOD error, please contact the IT crowd"
      must_not_contain:                # A list of strings which should NOT be in stderr (optional)
        - "Mission accomplished!"


The above YAML file contains all the possible options for a workflow test.

=======================
Running pytest-workflow
=======================
Run ``pytest`` from an environment with pytest-workflow installed.
Pytest will automatically gather files in the ``tests`` directory starting with
``test`` and ending in ``.yaml`` or ``.yml``.

The workflows are run automatically. Each workflow gets its own temporary
directory to run. These directories are cleaned up after the tests are
completed. If you wish to inspect the output of a failing workflow you can use
the ``--keep-workflow-wd`` flag to disable cleanup. This will also make sure
the logs of the pipeline in the temporary directory. The ``--keep-workflow-wd``
flag is highly recommended when debugging pipelines.

If you wish to change the temporary directory in which the workflows are run
use ``--basetemp <dir>`` to change pytest's base temp directory.

.. container:: warning

  WARNING: Directories defined as ``basetemp`` will have content deleted if it
  has the same name as any of the workflows you are running. DO NOT use
  ``--basetemp`` on directories you care about.

To run multiple workflows simultaneously you can use
``--workflow-threads <int>`` or ``--wt <int>`` flag. This defines the number
of workflows that can be run simultaneously. This will speed up things if
you have enough resources to process these workflows simultaneously.

Running specific workflows
----------------------------
To run a specific workflow use the ``--tag`` flag. Each workflow is tagged with
its own name and additional tags in the ``tags`` key of the yaml.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: moo
    tags:
      - animal
    command: echo moo
  - name: cock-a-doodle-doo
    tags:
      - rooster sound
      - animal
    command: echo cock-a-doodle-doo
  - name: vroom vroom
    tags:
      - car
    command: echo vroom vroom

With the command ``pytest --tag moo`` only the workflow named 'moo' will be
run. With ``pytest --tag 'rooster sound'`` only the 'cock-a-doodle-doo'
workflow will run. Multiple tags can be used like this:
``pytest --tag 'rooster sound' --tag animal`` This will run all workflows that
have both 'rooster sound' and 'animal'.

Internally names and tags are handled the same so if the following tests:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: hello
    command: echo 'hello'
  - name: hello2
    command: echo 'hello2'
    tags:
      - hello

are run with ``pytest --tag hello`` then both ``hello`` and ``hello2`` are run.

Examples
==================

Snakemake example
-----------------

An example yaml file that could be used to test a snakemake pipeline is listed
below.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: test-dry-run
      command: snakemake -n -r -p -s Snakefile
    - name: test-full-run
      command: snakemake -r -p -s Snakefile
      files:
        - "my_output.txt"
      stderr:
        contains:
         - "(100%) done"

WDL with Cromwell example
-------------------------

Below an example yaml file is explained which can be used to test a WDL
pipeline run through Cromwell.

One problem with Cromwell is the way it handles relative paths and how it
handles the input file:

+ Relative paths are written only within the ``cromwell-executions`` folder.
  If you want to write outside this folder you need absolute paths. This is
  fine but for testing your pipeline ``pytest-workflow`` creates a temporary
  folder from which the pipeline is run. You don't know beforehand which path
  this is, but you could use the environment variable ``$PWD``.
+ However the second problem is that inputs can only be supplied to Cromwell in
  a json file, not on the command line. So you cannot dynamically choose an
  output folder. You have to rewrite the input file.

To fix this problem you can write ``command`` to be a bash script that injects
``$PWD`` into the inputs.json.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: My pipeline
    command: >-
      bash -c '
      TEST_JSON=tests/inputs/my_pipeline_test1.json ;
      sed -i "2i\"my_pipeline.output_dir\":\"$PWD/test-output\"," $TEST_JSON ;
      cromwell run -i $TEST_JSON simple.wdl'
    files:
      - path: test-output/moo.txt.gz
        md5sum: 173fd8023240a8016033b33f42db14a2
    stdout:
      contains:
        - "WorkflowSucceededState"

``sed -i "2i\"my_pipeline.output_dir\":\"$PWD/test-output\"," $TEST_JSON``
inserts ``"my_pipeline.output_dir":"</pytest/temporary/dir>/test-output",`` on
the second line of ``$TEST_JSON``. This solves the problem. File paths can now
be traced from ``test-output`` as demonstrated in the example.
