These are files that are used to test the internal hashing function of pytest-
workflow.

The linked license file was used because it was bigger than 8192 bytes and 
therefore truly tests the function which uses a 8192 bytes block size.

The gzipped file is also bigger than 8192 bytes and tests the function on 
binary data.
